# Schedules
## Automated
Need to record information about:

* scheduling information (eg every Thursday at 1am)
* where the automation is scheduled (eg `cron`, AWS Eventbridge, Apache Airflow) and links to the scheduler
* what the job does
* link to troubleshooting procedure

## Manual
Example activities:

* Daily health checks: in theory, this isn't necessary because everything is automated. In practice...
* Audits: some organizations require yearly reviews with security team for compliance reasons
* Secret refreshes: do we need to update SSL certificates or rotate credentials to an outside service?
