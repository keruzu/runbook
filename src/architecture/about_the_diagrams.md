# About the Diagrams
I prefer the [C4 Model](https://c4model.com/) for diagrams.

According to the model, there are four levels of detail:

* **System Context**: All stakeholders should be able to read and understand this section. No product names, just areas of responsibility.
* **Container**: Nope, not that kind of container -- just a group of things. At this level we see applications and data stores.
* **Components**: A breakdown of each of the above containers into the nitty gritty of IaC-level configuration.
* **Code**: These diagrams should be automatically generated by your IDE or other tools.

The big idea is that we go from a very high-level view all the way down to where the unit-tests live.

We will show the users the System Context diagram in their landing page. The rest of the diagrams are for our internal use.
