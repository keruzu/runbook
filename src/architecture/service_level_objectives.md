# Service Level Objective (SLO)
These are our internal targets for the service, and should include availability targets as well as performance targets.

Our internal targets should also help define our error budget.

Example targets:

* Availability: service should be available X% over a rolling 30 day period.
* Response time: the response time for the 95th percentile of requests should be under X ms
* Error rate: expect less than X% service errors over a rolling hour-long period

## Error Budget Policy
The [error budget](https://sre.google/workbook/error-budget-policy/) helps us to determine how
our changes are impacting our customers.
