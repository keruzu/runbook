# Using the Service
This is the advertising to our user community about what the service is and why they would want to use it.
We should also be able to use the contents of this page for any presentations about our service to any interested party.

Our big picture information (literally the System Context diagram), and try to
let people know what they can expect, and also (just as importantly) what **NOT** to expect.

Should include a Responsible / Accountable / Consulted / Involved (RACI) matrix to help people understand what's expected of them.

Link to our service's catalog of use cases or modules, if this exists. 

Also need to include information about how to contact the team (eg tickets, email, instant messenger) and escalation points.

Note that any emails provided should always be to a mailing list. Individual email accounts are subject to change as people take on new
responsibilities, go on holidays, etc etc.
