# Component Map
For each component, a separate page that headlines the Component diagram.

Here are the types of information displayed on the top-level page:

* Source code repositories
* Related AWS accounts, GCP projects or Azure subscriptions
* Related objects (eg S3 buckets, Kubernetes clusters)
* IAM roles used
* Deployment information such as Jenkins configuration required (eg stages, secrets)
* Secret stores and keys used to 

Specific feature support is broken out under further pages. Examples of underlying pages:

* Schema descriptions for your data store
* Input validation controls (eg JSON schema, Python `pydantic`)
* Feature deep dives

Your wki should include tags, so these tags should match procedures for automatic linking.
