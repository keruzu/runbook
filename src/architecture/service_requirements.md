# Service Requirements Definition
This is where we capture the information that's usually lost to history: functional and non-functional requirements.

## Functional Requirements
In bullet points, this should be statements that all start with "Our user should be able to ..."

In another bullet point list, we should list out the things are specifically **NOT** going to be done.

## Non-Functional Requirements
In bullet points, list out information that will form the basis of any SLAs or SLOs.

In another bullet point list, we should list out the things are specifically **NOT** going to be targets.

## Service Level Agreement (SLA)
If we are responsible to an outside party, we need to document what we've agreed to do.
If there are different agreements to different parties, each should be identified here.

## Service Level Objective (SLO)
These are our internal targets for the service, and should include availability targets as well as performance targets.
