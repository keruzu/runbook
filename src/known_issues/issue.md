# Description
There are some things in our control, and some things outside of our control.

And there can also be a delay between when an issue is detected and when it is resolved.
We record each issue on a separate page and indicate it's status.

For example:

## At a Glance
| Metadata | Summary |
| --- | --- |
| Last update | xxxx / xx / xx |
| Symptoms | |
| Impact | |
| Impact severity | high, medium, low type severity |
| Remediation status | remediation / workaround / resolution |
| Resolution status | active / backlog / intake / unfixable / will not address |

## Issue Description
"What the user sees" or other information to indicate that there's an issue and that this user is or is not affected by it.

## Impact Details
Describe how the user will be impacted (eg will there be data loss?).

## Remediations
Describe the remediation, workaround or resolution, if any.
This should include step by step instructions that users can follow.

## Resolution Path
If the issue will NOT be addressed, need to indicate why. If users might be able to influence the decision, provide an escalation path.

Is this being worked on? Is this still active? Will this ever be addressed?

If this is being worked on, then provide links to tickets, branches or pull requests.
