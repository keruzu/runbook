## Known Issues
There are some things in our control, and some things outside of our control.

And there can also be a delay between when an issue is detected and when it is resolved.
We record each issue on a separate page and indicate it's status.

For example:

* Issue symptoms: "What the user sees" or other information to indicate that there's an issue
* Impact: how the issue affects the service eg loss of data, wrong spelling, delay
* Impact severity: high, medium, low type severity 
* Remediation, workaround or resolution: describe with enough detail that someone else can do it
* Status: Is this being worked on? Is this still active? Will this ever be addressed?
