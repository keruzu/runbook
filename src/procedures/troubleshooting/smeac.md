# DevOps Under Pressure
Use this template to help you structure your response and co-ordinate with multiple teams.

## Situation
Describes what we need to know to accomplish anything.

How did the situation occur? (Just the facts)

Should also identify the stakes (ie why should we care?).

### Responsible / Accountable / Consulted / Informed (RACI)

| Activity | Customer | Team #1 | Team #2 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Specify requirements | x | | |
| Build infrastructure | | x | |
| Build application | | | x |

## Mission
Specifically, what do we need to accomplish?

## Execution
How we get there.

Simple text about the steps to complete the mission.

Should identify who does what specific actions.

### Verification
What does *done* look like?

or when can we consider the crisis to be over?

Examples:

* KPIs
* SLAs / SLOs
* Service restored (eg heartbeats, real transactions)
* transactional volume

## Administration and Logistics

### Resources
What can we use?

Link to procedures documents

### Contact Lists
Who should we talk to about:

* on-call? Where's the schedule?
* Customer reps (eg Technical Account Managers (TAM))
* Vendor info
* Escalation chain
* Email lists

## Communications

### Frequency
Set expectations for how often you will send updates ( >= 1 hour).

### Channels
Separate emails or instant communications channels for different audiences.
This will enable your team to maintain expecations and messaging.

Internal communications (eg technical) need to be seperated from business teams.

### External Communications
These need to be curated so that someone doesn't hear an ETA for a specific task and confuse that with
service availability.

Specific wordings can cause customer relationship issues. Maintain consistent messages by reviewing with
authorized teams.
