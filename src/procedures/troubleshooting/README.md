# Troubleshooting Procedures
If you're here, it's probably 3am and it's a crisis for someone.

There should be a troubleshooting flowchart, and each underly page should should support that flowchart.

Every page should include

* steps to determine if this component is working or not
* error output of anything found previously. This is important because we'll be searching for this if it happens again.

Of course, this document can also serve as the basis for any business continuity planning.
