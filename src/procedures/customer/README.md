# End-User Procedures
Each document here should have a format similar to the following:

* Task description and desired outcomes
* Pre-requisites: eg permissions, other objects created
* Task procedure
* Example

Assume that the user doesn't really know about the service, but has the Internet so that they can figure out other pieces.

In addition, information about:

* Naming schemes: eg "all security groups end with -sg"
* Data types and units: Do I really have to put in the number of milliseconds (ie strictly an integer), or can I put in `1hr`?
* Other tips: For example, "Use -1 here to indicate no limits on transaction volume"
