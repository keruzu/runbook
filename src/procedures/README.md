# Procedures
Each one of these documents should be titled as if it starts with "How do I do ..."

If you are here, you know what's going on and are specifically looking to solve a particular issue.
The goal here is to provide "Just In Time" knowledge for busy people. Provide step-by-step instructions and copy-n-paste-friendly snippets.
If required, supporting information about how to choose various options and how it affects the operations of the system.
