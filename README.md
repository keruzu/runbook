# Runbooks
A runbook is a description of a service from the SRE perspective (ie from *inside* the sausage factory).

We are concerned about what the service is, how to know when the service is dead and how to keep the service running.

A runbook should be able to answer "What's that???" questions and also "How do I do X?" questions.

I generally try to start my solution architecture by filling out a runbook, so then I can capture all of the questions
(and later answers!) that I have from the various stakeholders. Once I have enough information to roughly understand
how people and other systems will use the system, then the completed runbook becomes my final project artifact.
