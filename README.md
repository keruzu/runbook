# Runbooks
A runbook is a description of a service from the SRE perspective (ie from *inside* the sausage factory).

We are concerned about what the service is, how to know when the service is dead and how to keep the service running.

A runbook should be able to answer "What's that???" questions and also "How do I do X?" questions.

I generally try to start my solution architecture by filling out a runbook, so then I can capture all of the questions
(and later answers!) that I have from the various stakeholders. Once I have enough information to roughly understand
how people and other systems will use the system, then the completed runbook becomes my final project artifact.

## Why Markdown?
The [Markdown format](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/) is a low-effort way to write documentation.
It can also be used to produce output in other formats (eg HTML) for easier consumption for other teams.

## About this Repository
The format of my runbooks has changed over time, as I find myself re-inventing it wherever I go.
I've recorded this here so that I can use it and now so can you.

Enjoy!
